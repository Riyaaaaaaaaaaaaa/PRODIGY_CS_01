# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project provides a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher for both encryption and decryption purposes.

Features
1.Encryption: Convert plaintext to ciphertext by shifting letters.
2.Decryption: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext by reversing the shift.
3.Custom Shift Values: Specify the number of positions each letter should be shifted.
4.Case Insensitivity: Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
5.Non-Alphabet Characters: Non-alphabet characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) are preserved in their original form.
